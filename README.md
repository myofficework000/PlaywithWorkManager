# Work manager all kind of use cases and types of uses are implemented in this project

What is work manager
WorkManager is a powerful library in Android for managing background tasks, introduced in Android Architecture Components. It provides a flexible and robust solution for deferrable, asynchronous tasks that need to run even if the app's process is killed or the device is rebooted.

Key features include:
Backward Compatibility: Works on devices running Android 4.0.3 (API level 15) and higher.
Task Management: Handles tasks efficiently, executing them according to specified constraints like network availability, device charging, and idle state.
Flexibility: Supports one-off tasks and periodic tasks. It also allows tasks to be chained or combined using parallel execution.
Lifecycle Awareness: Integrates smoothly with Android components like Activity, Fragment, Service, and BroadcastReceiver, ensuring tasks respect the lifecycle of these components.
Persistence: Guarantees that tasks are executed even if the app is killed or the device restarts, by persisting them using SQLite database or SharedPreferences.
Overall, WorkManager simplifies the implementation of background tasks in Android, ensuring reliability, efficiency, and compatibility across different Android versions.
